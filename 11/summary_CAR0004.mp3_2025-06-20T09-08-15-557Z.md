## Summary

A 25-year-old healthy male student and part-time postman presents with a sharp chest pain localized over his heart, lasting a few seconds at a time, starting three days ago. The pain worsens with coughing and lying down but improves when leaning forward. He rates the pain as 6/10 and sometimes feels it radiate to his neck. He denies shortness of breath, palpitations, dizziness, or other symptoms. He recently recovered from the flu. He has no significant past medical history, medications other than occasional Tylenol, or allergies. His father suffered a fatal heart attack two weeks ago, which heightens his concern. The clinician plans to perform an ECG and possibly blood tests to evaluate his condition and reassures him while further investigations are underway.
